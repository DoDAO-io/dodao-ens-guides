Some context on grant ideas
The Grant should be focused on accomplishing the following for ENS:
Usability - improving the user experience
Community - growing the ecosystem
Tooling - improving the developer experience
Governance - building tools and enhancements for governance
Education - content creation and initiatives to improve educational resources
