      ### About ENS Constitution
      The ENS constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.
      
      Each article has examples of permissible and non-permissible actions. These examples are illustrative and should 
      not be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.
      
      It was signed by more than 84,350 accounts. Digital copy of the constitution can be found at [https://ensdao.eth.limo/constitution.pdf](https://ensdao.eth.limo/constitution.pdf)

      ### About ENS Foundation

      company cannot have shareholders and cannot pay out dividends to its directors or members.

      part of the ENS core team. The directors are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the foundation.
      
      ### About Constiution Proposal
      The ENS constitution proposal was proposed and passed in November 2021. The proposal required  at least 67% 
      approval of all votes cast in the first week of the token launch by users when they claim their tokens.

    name: Name ownership shall not be infringed
    content: |
      ENS governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of ENS users to retain names they own,
      or unfairly discriminate against name owners’ ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.

      ### EXAMPLES
      #### Permissible      
      ENS governance may enact a change affecting the registration or extension costs of all names based on transparent 
      criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.      
      
      #### Not Permissible
      ENS governance must not enact a change increasing or reducing the extension costs of a list of existing ENS names,
      as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group

    name: Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism
    content: |
      The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed 
      with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing 
      development and improvement of ENS. ENS governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.

      ### EXAMPLES
      #### Permissible      
      ENS governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations 
      induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing ENS operations 
      at a reasonable level.     
      
      #### Not Permissible
      ENS governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside ENS, because such a fee would 
      be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.

    name: Income funds ENS and other public goods
    content: |
      Any income generated to the ENS treasury is to be used first of all to ensure the long-term viability of ENS, and 
      to fund continuing development and improvement of the ENS system. Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve
      this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as ENS governance sees fit

      ENS governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles 
      outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.
      
      ### EXAMPLES
      #### Permissible      
      ENS governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to ENS or Ethereum, so long as doing so does 
      not affect the long-term viability of ENS.    
      
      #### Not Permissible
      ENS governance must not use the funds to support projects that conflict with the goals of ENS.

    name: ENS Integrates with the global namespace
    content: |
      In order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system, ENS aims to integrate with the legacy DNS 
      naming system to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing decentralization of ENS. ENS governance will not 
      enact changes that compromise ENS’s ability to do this.
      
      ### EXAMPLES
      #### Permissible      
      ENS governance should grant control of a top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.    
      
      #### Not Permissible
      ENS governance must not create new top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to ENS by a DNS 
      authority
