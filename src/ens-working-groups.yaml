      The work-related activities of the ENS DAO takes place within working groups. Each working group has a 
      specific focus area and mission, aligned with the constitution and needs of the DAO.

      There are currently three foundational working groups:
      **Meta-Governance** : providing governance oversight and support of the management and operation of the ENS DAO and working groups;
      **ENS Ecosystem**: continuing development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem, with a focus on all technical matters related to ENS;
      **Public Goods**: amplifying ENS as a public good and funding public goods within the ENS ecosystem, and more broadly within web3.

      Working Group Stewards
      Each working group shall be managed by five stewards (hereafter a ‘Steward’ or ‘Stewards’).
      Stewards will be elected, unless otherwise stated in these rules, to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a ‘Term’ or ‘Terms’).
      There are two Terms each calendar year:
      The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term (‘First Term’); and
      The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year (‘Second Term’).
      Stewards are responsible for managing the operations of each working group.
      The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:
      Managing operational tasks related to the administration of a working group;
      Maintaining a description that sets forth the focus and intent of the working group;
      Developing working group goals for the Term and providing a clear road map for achieving those goals, to be published in the ENS governance forum within the first 30 days of a Term;
      Approving the creation and dissolution of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks;
      Requesting working group funds from the DAO; and
      Approving and making funding available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group.
      To request working group funds, Stewards of all working groups will collaborate to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation 40 (‘Collective Proposal’), to the DAO within the final 15 days (inclusive) of the months of January, March, July, and October each calendar year (each a ‘Funding Window’).
      In order for a working group to have a funding request included in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding Window, the funding request must have passed as a Social Proposal in the same Funding Window.
      In the case of an emergency, where working group funds are needed by a working group outside of a Funding Window, an Executable Proposal may be submitted at any time by a Steward of a working group to request funds from the DAO.
