An RFP is a request from the DAO for \ncontributors to offer to do work on its behalf, and receive compensation in return.\n\nIf you identify a need that you believe you can address, you can write an RFP. Once the RFP is passed, anyone can \nwrite a proposal in response and be awarded the work. Even if you believe you can do the work yourself, you will \nstill need to pass an RFP in order to be awarded the work (and corresponding compensation) by the DAO.\n\nRFPs can be short or long, depending on the project. An RFP for improving the DAO's documentation may only be a \nparagraph or two long, and proposals for it will be equally short. However, an RFP for managing the DAO's funds \nmay be lengthy, and a successful proposal could be multiple pages justifying the proposer's ability to take on the job.\n",

Ensure at least 100k ENS is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has \n   enough delegated ENS to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.\n2.
