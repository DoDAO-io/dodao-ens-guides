      "content": "Ethereum name service(ENS) is a decentralized naming protocol that maps the human-readable addresses to the cryptographic addresses \nor Ethereum addresses on the Ethereum mainnet. It works similarly to DNS, where DNS maps the domain to the IP addresses but has a significantly different \narchitecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nJust like DNS, ENS also uses dot-separated hierarchical domain names. The owner of a domain has complete control over its subdomains. So, if a user owns alice.eth, \nthat user can also create pay.alice.eth or mail.alice.eth, and so on. ENS makes it easy for users to create these subdomains from the main domain.\nUsers can set subdomains without any limit and users have access to assign new owners for the domains and sub domains.\n\nAn ENS domain with an .eth TLD (top-level domain) is an NFT. So, it can be traded like an NFT in marketplaces like Open Sea. For example, Alice.eth is an NFT, but Alice.xyz is not an NFT.\nENS domains are a great way to manage multiple web services in one easy-to-use, decentralized address. The following records can be added to the ENS domains\n* ETH/BTC/Doge/LTC/Atom/Dash +40 other wallet addresses.\n* IPFS content hashes.\n* Custom text records\n* Keywords\n* URLs\n* Github handles\n* Twitter handles\n* Email addresses\n* Avatars\n* Telegram and reddit handles\n",

We can register our owned DNS domains in ENS. ENS domains can have multiple use cases example, they can be used for payments, web \ndomains(can be used for multiple websites), Twitter handles, email addresses, etc. The domain names can have emojis in ENS.

The registry contract contains all the necessary \ninformation like the owner address of the domain, the address of the resolver contract, etc. The resolver contract manages the queries for example if an user wants to associate url or email with the ENS domain resolver will associate the text records to the domain. Resolver maps ENS names to addresses.\n\n### Registry \nThis is the smart contract that stores all the domains and subdomains with the following records.\n1. Address of the owner\n2. Address of resolver contract\n3. TTL(Time-to-live) the time period for the expiration of the domain.\n\nAll the records are stored in Record(struct data type). The domain names are mapped as hashes using namehash algorithm and called nodes. The nodes are mapped to the Record, which \ncontains the addresses of the owner, the resolver contract, and the Time-to-live value. The domains are not directly stored in registry. Instead, they are stored as hashes. Hashes are \nexcellent for providing a fixed-length identifier that can be passed around easily between contracts. Before being hashed with namehash, names are first normalized using a process called UTS-46 normalization.\nThe output of the namehash is called “Node.”\n\n### Resolver \nResolvers are responsible for translating the name to the addresses or other data provided by the user. Resolving a name in ENS is a two-step process: First, ask the registry what resolver is responsible for the name,\nand second, ask that resolver for the answer to your query. A resolver can be any contract that meets the relevant standards to act as a resolver. For example according to EIP-137 the resolver contract must have the function.\n```\nsupportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) constant returns (bool);\n",

User can set a public resolver or a custom resolver. Name is hashed and recorded in the registry, \nalong with their node's address, resolver address, and TTL. The nodes are mapped to the record, which has the owner’s address, resolver address, and TTL. We need to assign the resolver after owning the domain successfully. \nWe can set up a public resolver that has most of the necessary functionalities. However, users can also create and use their own custom resolvers according to their specific needs. Users are also required to setup reverse \nrecords for replacing of addresses with domain names such that names are displayed instead of addresses.\n\nResolving a name in ENS is a two-step process: First, ask the registry what resolver is responsible for the name, and second, ask that resolver for the answer to your query. The domain is owned by the owner till the deadline \nafter that the owner has to renew it within 90 days' grace time. After the grace period, the name is released for registration by anyone with a temporary premium which decreases over a 28 days period to prevent domain squatters.\nThe released and registered names can be viewed in [Dune analytics dashboard](https://dune.com/makoto/ens-released-to-be-released-names). Anyone can extend a domain’s expiration period but the ownership is still maintained by the owner \nof that domain. Currently registration and renewal cost $5/year for names that are five characters or longer. Four character names cost $160/year, and three character names cost $640/year. Domains are bought using Eth similarly gas fees are paid in Eth.\n\n### ENS Domains as NFTs \n\nENS domains with .eth are NFTs because they are in ERC-721 standards. All NFTs have a unique uint256 tokenID from which we can convert to the actual content or art or data. The domains with .eth are traded and exchanged like NFTs. The tokenID’s are globally unique.\n\n**Deriving tokenID from the ENS name**\nFor example, to derive tokenID for the domain harry.eth we use the following code to implement.\n\n```\nconst ethers = require('ethers')\nconst BigNumber = ethers.BigNumber\nconst utils = ethers.utils\nconst name = 'harry'\nconst labelHash = utils.keccak256(utils.toUtf8Bytes(name))\nconst tokenId = BigNumber.from(labelHash).toString()\n```\nwe are using etherjs predefined functions to produce the keccak256 hash of the name, and we are converting the hash to the number using BigNumber method, then it is converted to a string.\n",

It describes the functions and requirements of these contracts, as well as the\noption for adding subdomains. Finally, it outlines the main improvements to the ENS protocol including the public resolver contract.\n\n**Reverse solution-EIP-181**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to reverse the process for ENS domains. For example, if we look at Etherscan, we can see that the \"from\" ID is currently an address. However, after this proposal reverse \nsolution is enacted, the address will be replaced with the ENS domain name only if that address owns a ENS domain and has set a primary ENS name. Anyone can configure a name to resolve to an address, \nregardless of ownership of that address. Reverse records allow the owner of an address to claim a name as authoritative for that address.\n\n**Text records-EIP-634**\n\nThis proposal implements a new interfaceID for storing the text records by which ENS domain can be used instead of the records. We can link global keys like email, discription, url etc. We can link \npublic keys like social media handles, github handles, etc. This is the main motive of this proposal.\n",
