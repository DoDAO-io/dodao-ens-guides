      "content": "### About ENS Constitution\nThe ENS constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.\n\nEach article has examples of permissible and non-permissible actions. These examples are illustrative and should \nnot be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.\n\nIt was signed by more than 84,350 accounts. Digital copy of the constitution can be found at [https://ensdao.eth.limo/constitution.pdf](https://ensdao.eth.limo/constitution.pdf)\n\n### About ENS Foundation\nThe ENS Foundation is a non-profit organization that is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. This type of foundation \ncompany cannot have shareholders and cannot pay out dividends to its directors or members. \n\nThe ENS Foundation has three directors: Nick Johnson, Brantly Millegan, and Kevin Gaspar. These individuals are also \npart of the ENS core team. The directors are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the foundation.\n\n### About Constiution Proposal\nThe ENS constitution proposal was proposed and passed in November 2021. The proposal required  at least 67% \napproval of all votes cast in the first week of the token launch by users when they claim their tokens.\n\nHere is the link to the proposal - [https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposed-ens-constitution/814](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposed-ens-constitution/814)\n",
