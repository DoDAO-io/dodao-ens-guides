## ENS Working Groups


## Overview

The work-related activities of the ENS DAO takes place within working groups. Each working group has a 
specific focus area and mission, aligned with the constitution and needs of the DAO.

There are currently three foundational working groups:
**Meta-Governance** : providing governance oversight and support of the management and operation of the ENS DAO and working groups;
**ENS Ecosystem**: continuing development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem, with a focus on all technical matters related to ENS;
**Public Goods**: amplifying ENS as a public good and funding public goods within the ENS ecosystem, and more broadly within web3.

## Working Group Stewards

Working Group Stewards

Stewards will be elected, unless otherwise stated in these rules, to serve within working groups for a set period 
of time (hereafter known as a ‘Term’ or ‘Terms’).

There are two Terms each calendar year:
* The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the 
  second Term (‘First Term’); and
* The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the 
  First Term of the following year (‘Second Term’).

Stewards are responsible for managing the operations of each working group.

Stewards are responsible for the management and administration of a working group. This includes creating a description 
of the group's focus and purpose, as well as developing goals for the term and providing a road map for achieving 
those goals. Stewards also have the authority to approve the creation or dissolution of sub-groups or workstreams 
within a working group.

Not only do they have to request funding from the DAO, but they also have to approve and make funding available to 
sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within the working group. In order to request working group funds, Stewards 
of all working groups will need to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation 
40 ('Collective Proposal'), to the DAO within the final 15 days of each calendar year (each a 'Funding Window').

For a working group to have its funding request included in a proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding 
Window, the request must first pass as a Social Proposal during that same Funding Window. In an emergency situation 
where working group funds are needed by a group outside of a Funding Window, an Executable Proposal may be submitted 
at any time by a Steward of the working group to request funds from the DAO.
